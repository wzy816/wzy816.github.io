## [Why I'm unreachable and maybe you should be too](https://levels.io/contact/)

> A lot of my new ideas slowly boil in my head over weeks, months, sometimes years. And undisturbed thinking and working time helps me get into that state. That's why I like to lead my life async.

## [智变时代 / 全面理解机器智能与生成式 AI 加速的新工业革命](https://www.indigox.me/understanding-genai-and-the-new-industrial-revolution/)

> 模型的竞赛，就是资本和用户的竞赛

> 其中 Ilya 提到，他坚信两件事情，第一就是模型的架构，只要足够深，到了一定的深度就会 “Bigness is the Betterness”，简单说就是大力出奇迹，算力加数据，越大越好，这也是为什么转换器架构（Transformer）要比他们之前使用的长短时记忆（LSTM）架构要适合扩展；第二就是任何范式都需要一个引擎，这个引擎能够不断被改进和产生价值，如果说内燃机是工业革命范式的动力引擎，现在这个引擎就是 Transformer。

> “最重要的不是它解决的具体问题，而是广泛意义的通用性在增加” — Sam Altman 在达沃斯论坛的演讲

> “如果你能够高效地压缩信息，你就已经得到了知识，不然你没法压缩信息”。

> “人们总是高估一项科技所带来的短期效益，却又低估它的长期影响。” - 阿玛拉定律

> 现在 AI 正在强制逆转 SaaS 这个缩写的含义，从“软件即服务”转变为“服务即软件”，软件既能组织任务，也能执行任务，你无需雇佣额外劳动力，它们是“内置”的，传统的劳动力市场最终将和软件融合成为一个新市场！

> 杰文斯观察到，当蒸汽机的效率提高时，使用更少的煤炭就可以做更多的事情，但实际上煤炭的消费量却增加了。人们并不只是用蒸汽机做之前同样的事情，因为成本更低，他们开始用蒸汽机做更多其它的事情。
>
> 现代经济学中有一个简单的定义：当商品、服务或资源的供应或容量增加导致其消费增加时，就会发生诱导需求。

> 随着能源、智能和灵活性的成本趋近于零，整个经济将变得更大，结构上更加盈利。科技公司将有巨大的机会销售他们即插即用的劳动力和智能，本质上是将现在分散且不一致的人类劳动力产品化、集中化、按需化和作为服务给软件化，即 SaaS 化。智能的加入，让每个行业看起来都更像软件行业。它们增长更快，利润更高，研发投入更多。软件吞噬世界，AI 吞噬软件！

> 在智能时代，将劳动力支出转化为研发支出将改变公司的成本结构，虽然这需要更多的前期投资，但能降低生产和服务的边际成本。软件行业是这里的代表，它应该是法律许可的行业内，利润率最高的行业之一了。

> 或许在不久的将来，我们只剩下生产智能的公司与生产机器人的公司，也或者是能够自动化完成特定任务的智能机器公司；所有的生产与服务，全部都由机器来完成。

> 神经网络的成功，让连接主义全面逆袭，这种好的近似就是向量，包括在自然语言处理领域。大家相信，符号进入大脑后会转化为大型向量，所有内部处理都通过这些大型向量完成。如果你想生成输出，就需要再次生成符号

> 柏拉图表征假说。该假说的核心观点是，不同的神经网络模型在不同的数据和模态上训练，最终会在其表征空间中收敛成一个共享的现实世界统计模型。
>
> 通俗来讲就是强大的模型往往都是相似的，弱小的模型就各有各的弱法；

> 人类智慧有两种最高水准的表现，一个是艺术，另一个就是科学，它们都依赖人类的创造力。科学在某种意义上是数据压缩，我们用定律和方程表征宇宙的动态，从而理解发生了什么。但在这个过程中，还有一个超越数据压缩的方面，就是我们在发挥创造力时，我们自身也发生了变化；这一点类似于艺术：当你感知某个事物时，它也改变了你。如果我们富有创造力，就能提出新想法。然而，目前的 AI 模型在创造或生成时，它现在还无法根据自身发现的内容进行更新，这是人类目前还优于 AI 的重要方面，但过不了太久这个优势应该也不存在了。

> 因为柏拉图表征的假说，还有计算不可约化的限制，我们也许永远不会有一个无所不能的 AI，但我们一定会有多种形态的超级 AI，在可以约化的口袋里面计算和探索，

> 从某种角度来看，就像 Andrej Karpathy 写道的，AGI 看起来并不像一个可以自行进化的超级智能体，脱离我们的控制进入网络空间制造致命的病原体，或者从某个研究所的地下室越狱出来创造一个超级公司来控制人类。相反，它更像是自动驾驶，融合到经济之中的、能改变社会的自动化进程。这个过程是渐进的，社会既是观察者也是参与者，并且其扩张速度在许多方面都受到限制，包括法规、劳动力的迁移、信息、物质还有能源。世界不会因为它而爆炸，而是会适应、改变和重构。

## [The AI Workforce is Here: The Rise of a New Labor Market](https://www.nfx.com/post/ai-workforce-is-here?)

> AI is forcing a reversal of the SaaS acronym. From Software-as-a-Service to Service-as-a-Software.

> The big picture: the rise of AI workers is creating a fusion of the software and labor market. This is going to create massive opportunities for Founders.

## [Geoffrey Hinton | On working with Ilya, choosing problems, and the power of intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4IQOBka8bc)

> So let me give you three different views of language, um, and how it relates to cognition. There's the old fashioned symbolic view, which is cognition consists of having strings of symbols in some kind of cleaned up logical language where there's no ambiguity and applying rules of inference. And that's what cognition is. It's just these symbolic manipulations on things that are like strings of language symbols. Um, so that's one extreme view. An opposite extreme view is no, no, once you get inside the head it's all vectors. So symbols come in, you convert those symbols into big vectors and all the stuff inside is done with big vectors.And then if you want to produce output, you produce symbols again.

> Understanding is knowing how to convert the symbols into these vectors and knowing how the elements of the vector should interact to predict the vector for the next symbol. That's what understanding is, both in these big language models and in our brains.

> So my last couple of years at Google, I was thinking about ways of trying to make analog computation so that instead of using like a megawatt, we could use like 30 watts like the brain and we could run these big language models in analog hardware. And I never made it work and, but I started really appreciating digital computation. So if you're gonna use that low power analog computation, every piece of hardware is gonna be a bit different. And the idea is the learning is gonna make use of the specific properties of that hardware. And that's what happens with people.All our brains are different. Um, so we can't then take the weights in your brain and put them in my brain. The hardware's different, the precise properties of the individual neurons are different. The learning used to make—has learned to make use of all that.And so we are mortal in the sense that the weights in my brain are no good for any other brain. When I die, those weights are useless. Um, we can get information from one to another rather inefficiently by I produce sentences and you figure out how to change your weights. So you would've said the same thing. That's called distillation. But that's a very inefficient way of communicating knowledge. And with digital systems, they're immortal because once you've got some weights, you can throw away the computer, just store the weights on a tape somewhere and now build another computer, put those same weights in and if it's digital it can compute exactly the same thing as the other system did. So digital systems can share weights and that's incredibly much more efficient if you've got a whole bunch of digital systems and they each go and do a tiny bit of learning and they start with the same weights, they do a tiny bit of learning, and then they share their weights again. Um, they all know what all the others learned, we can't do that. And so they're far superior to us in being able to share knowledge.

## [Generative AI’s Act Two](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/)

> We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.

> User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.

## [AI and the Frontier Paradox](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/)

> Sequoia founder Don Valentine would ask founders two questions: “why now?” and “so what?” At the heart of these questions is the combination of curiosity and rigor that asks what has changed in the world (why now?) and what will this mean (so what?).

> The AI effect is actually part of a larger human phenomenon we call the frontier paradox. Because we ascribe to humans the frontier beyond our technological mastery, that frontier will always be ill-defined. Intelligence is not a thing that we can capture but an ever-approaching horizon that we turn into useful tools. Technology is the artifice of intelligence forged over millennia of human collaboration and competition.

## [Will AIs Take All Our Jobs and End Human History—or Not? Well, It’s Complicated…](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/will-ais-take-all-our-jobs-and-end-human-history-or-not-well-its-complicated/)

> Will this end? Will we eventually have automated everything? Discovered everything? Invented everything? At some level, we now know that the answer is a resounding no. Because one of the consequences of the phenomenon of computational irreducibility is that there’ll always be more computations to do—that can’t in the end be reduced by any finite amount of automation, discovery or invention.

## [what is amara's law](https://thevirtulab.com/what-is-amaras-law)

> “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”

## [DREAM-LOGIC, THE INTERNET AND ARTIFICIAL THOUGHT](https://www.edge.org/conversation/david_gelernter-dream-logic-the-internet-and-artificial-thought)

> Many people believe that "thinking" is basically the same as "reasoning."
>
> But when you stop work for a moment, look out the window and let your mind wander, you are still thinking. Your mind is still at work. This sort of free-association is an important part of human thought. No computer will be able to think like a man unless it can free-associate.
>
> Many people believe that reality is one thing and your thoughts are something else. Reality is on the outside; the mental landscape created by your thoughts is inside your head, within your mind. (Assuming that you're sane.)
>
> Yet we each hallucinate every day, when we fall asleep and dream. And when you hallucinate, your own mind redefines reality for you; "real" reality, outside reality, disappears. No computer will be able to think like a man unless it can hallucinate.

> In fact, the human mind moves back and forth along a spectrum defined by ordinary logic at one end and "dream logic" at the other. "Dream logic" makes just as much sense as ordinary "day logic"; it simply follows different rules.

> Creativity has always been fascinating. Cognitive psychologists generally agree that creativity happens when a new analogy is invented.

> Most new analogies lead nowhere, but occasionally they reveal something important. Creativity doesn't operate when your focus is high; only when your thoughts have started to drift is creativity possible. We find creative solutions to a problem when it lingers at the back of our minds, not when it monopolizes attention by standing at the front. You can't make yourself fall asleep; nor can you make yourself have a creative inspiration (in the way you can make yourself solve an arithmetic problem). Sleep and creativity happen only when your thoughts drift beyond your control.

> No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.

> as the philosopher Paul Ziff insisted, intelligence can only mean human or human-like intelligence.

> If your new form of intelligence is human-like, it's not new. If it isn't human-like, it's not intelligence.

## [《圣山》导演评论轨摘抄](https://movie.douban.com/review/10059515/)

> I'm very happy to record these commentaries
> because "The Holy Mountain" was a great adventure for me.
> I shot this film in a different life.
> I am not the same man anymore.
> In these commentaries I'll try to resurrect an Alejandro that no longer exists.
> I will make a concerted effort to bring him back to the present,
> because I like the young man that I once was.
> He was trying with all his soul to make a sacred film.
> He wanted to change mankind with his films.
> He thought that cinema was better than LSD.
> He thought his film would be a source of enlightenment for the audience.

## [More people should write](https://jsomers.net/blog/more-people-should-write)

> is that the difference between you and a zoologist or you and a botanist is that the botanist, when she looks at a flower, has a question in mind. She’s trying to generate questions. For her the flower is the locus of many mental threads, some nascent, some spanning her career. Her field notebook is not some convenient way to store lifeless data to be presented in lifeless papers so that other scientists can replicate some dull experiment; it’s the site of a collision between a mind and a world.

> That’s the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.

## [Interview with illustrator Senbon Umishima - Distilling Curiosity into Creation](https://www.pixivision.net/en/a/7517)

> I think it's a good idea to consider what sort of practice techniques work best for you. If you find something that works, try doing it every day.

> Once I've finished a drawing, a one-to-one relationship with the work is created between it and everyone who sees it. I can't barge into that relationship just because I'm the artist.

## 《radical candor》 by Kim Scott

> To have a good relationship, you have to be your whole self and care about each of the people who work for you as a human being. It is not just business: it is personal. and deeply personal. I call this dimension "Care Personally".
>
> THe second dimension involves telling people when their work isn't good enough ... Challenging people generally pisses them off... and yet challenging people is often the best way to show them that you care when you're the boss. This dimension I call "Challenge Directly".

> |                     | Challenge Directly (-)   | Challenge Directly (+) |
> | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
> | Care Personally (+) | Ruinous Empathy          | Radical Candor         |
> | Care Personally (-) | Manipulative Insincerity | Obnoxious Aggression   |

> the "Get Stuff Done" (GSD) wheel:
>
> Listen => Clarify => Debate => Decide => Persuade => Execute => Learn => Listen

> If quiet listening involves being silent to give people room to talk, loud listening is about saying things intended to get a reaction out of them.

> create a culture of listening
>
> 0. have a simple system for employees to use to generate ideas and voice complaints.
> 1. make sure that at least some of the issues raised are quickly addressed
> 2. regularly offer explanations as to why the other issues aren't being addressed.

> Sometimes creating a culture of listening is simply a matter of managing meetings the right way ... "give the quiet ones a voice".

> push yourself and your direct reports to understand and convey thoughts and ideas more clearly

> Georgia O'Keeffe said, "It is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things."

> [staff meeting] an effective staff meeting has three goals: it reviews how things have gone the previous week, allows people to share important updates, and forces the team to clarify the most important decisions and debates for the coming week

> when a team debated, both the ideas and the people came out more beautiful -- results well worth all the friction and noise

> make sure that individual egos and self-interest don't get in the way of an objective quest for the best answer.

> that is why kick-ass bosses often do not decide themselves, but rather create a clear decision-making process that empowerers people closest to the facts to make as many decisions as possible.

> make people feel free at work is to relinquish unilateral authority

> The basic premise here is that when everyone on your team is able to bring the best of what they've got mentally, emotionally, and physically to their work, they are more fulfilled in their jobs, they work better with one another, and the team bets better results.

> When you encourage people to criticize you publicly, you get the chance to show your team that you really, genuinely want the criticism. You also set an ideal for the team as a whole: everyone should embrace criticism that help us do our jobs better.
> praise in public, criticize in private

> a slight modification if you're talking to your boss instead of your employee -- ask permission to give guidance.

## [Truthseeking is the ground in which other principles grow](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kbnJHpapusMJZb6Gs/truthseeking-is-the-ground-in-which-other-principles-grow)

> Anything I want to do, anything I want to change, rests on having contact with reality. If I don’t have enough, I might as well be pushing buttons at random.
> ...
> This is why I think constantly seeking contact with reality is the meta principle without which all (consequentialist) principles are meaningless.

## [How to send progress updates](https://www.spakhm.com/updates-howto)

## 《乌合之众》

> 个人的自觉的个性消失，并且感情和思想要和其他人一起转向一个共同的方向，这是想要组成群体的个人所必须表现出的特征。

> 无意识现象不但存在于有机体的生活中，并且存在于智力活动中，并发挥着一种完全压倒性的重要作用。

> 仅仅从数量上考虑的话，群体便会比个体拥有一种势不可挡的力量，这种力量可以帮助群体发泄自己本能的欲望。而如果是独立的个人，他是不敢发泄某些欲望的，只能加以限制。当处于群体中时，某个个人就会不自觉地产生一种念头：群体不同于个人，是个无名氏，是不需要个人一样承担责任的。

> 在智力上，群体总是会比孤立的个人低，但是从感情上和群体激起的行动上看，群体的表现会比个人更好，也有可能更差。

> 群体是所有刺激因素的奴隶。... 孤立的个人可以控制、主宰自己的反应行为，他有这种能力，但是群体却没有这种能力。

> 群体失去了批判的能力，他们永远都在轻信，永远处于无意识的领域，并且随时都会听从于所有的暗示。

> 在群体中很容易产生一些神话，并且广为流传，这些神话的产生，不仅仅是因为群体的人极端轻信，而且是因为，这些事件在群体的思想中被曲解了。

> 群体表现出来的感情多种多样，有好有坏，但是却有一个突出的特点，就是非常简单，并且夸张。

> 群体的感情是简单而极端的，所有提供给他们的各种想法、意见和信念，对于群体来说，他们要么全部接受，要么全部拒绝，要么将它视为真理，要么就是绝对的错误言论。

> 每一种文明，其实都只是几个基本观念的产物，而且是有数的几个，这些观念很少变化和革新。... 群体能够接受的观念，基本上可以分为两类：一类是来去匆匆的观念，它只受一时的环境影响而产生。... 第二类是基本的观念，在遗传规律、公众意见和环境的影响下，这些观念具有极强的稳定性。

> 群体所能接受的观念，必须是简单明了的，所有，一种观念想要变得通俗易懂，就必须经过一番深刻的改造。

> 群体是没有理性的，群体不会受到理性的影响。

> 群体用来推理的各种观念之间，没有逻辑性，只有表面的连续性和相似性。

> 群体由于推理能力的缺乏，他们的想象力就变得强大并且非常活跃，甚至异常敏感。

> 在群体想象力的基础上，一代代的侵略者有了自己的权利以及国家的威力。要想很好地领导一个群体，那么领导者就必须在群体的想象力这方面下很大的功夫去研究。

> 几乎所有时代、所有国家的著名政客和君王，也都必须将群体的想象力视为自己权力的基础所在，不敢轻易与这种群体想象力做对抗。

> 如何才能影响群体的想象力？... 最不可取的方法便是借助智力和推理，也就是不能采用论证的方法。

> 往往那些最令人吃惊的鲜明形象最为有用。有了这些鲜明的形象，并不需要任何多余的解释，仅仅加上几个不同寻常的神奇事实，就足以刺激群众的想象力了。

> 对于一个民族，最合适最理想的就是在保留过去制度的情况下，通过微弱的、不易察觉的方式，细微地去改进它们。

> 群体会坚守传统的观念，不希望发生变革，这种思想是极其顽固的，最为明显的例子便是有地产的群体。

> 一个民族并不具备能够真正改变其制度的能力。

> 如果群体中发生过政治动荡或信仰的变化时，他们会对一些词语唤起的形象产生厌恶的情感。这个时候，对于一个真正的政治家就是一种考验，他们的当务之急一定是尽快变换说法，但前提是不能伤害事物本身。... 执政府和帝国所做的具体工作可以概括为，使用新的名称将过去存在的制度进行新的包装。

> 让某种观念进入群众的头脑，最可靠最有效的办法，就是做出断言，并且简洁有力，不用理睬任何的证据和推理。... 如果让断言产生真正的影响，那就必须保持措辞不变，不断地重复断言。... 如果有效地重复一个断言，并且在这个过程中没有任何异议，这个时候形成的意见就成了所谓的流行意见。... 在这个过程中，强大的传染就开始了。各种观念、情绪、信念，在群众中都具有强大的传染力，就像微生物一样。

> 因为传染，群体的意见和信念会得到普及，这种普及，绝不是因为推理和论证。

> 非常伟大的、普遍的信仰，它们的数量是非常有限的，真正的文明的基础便由这些信仰构成，这些信仰的兴衰，是历史上每一个文明种族的大事件。
